# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked an external CSS file
- Applied basic typography and spacing
- Styled header, footer, navigation, and images

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector (body, h1, h2)
- Group selector (header, footer)
- Descendant selector (nav a)
- Pseudo-class selector (a:hover)
- Element selector (img)

## One thing I struggled with

## One improvement I want to do next
