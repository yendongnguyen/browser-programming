# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Added semantic layout using header, main, section, and footer
- Created a portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video
- Added an areas of interest section using a list
- Improved accessibility with alt text and a skip link

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: <header>
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  It represents introductory content, including my name and personal information.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: <section> and <figure>
- Where in the page: Portfolio / Works section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Section groups related portfolio content, and figure + figcaption describe images and media.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: <footer>
- Where in the page: Bottom of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  It contains contact and social media links related to the whole page.

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: 
- What I accepted as-is:
  Basic HTML structure and README template
- What I modified manually:
  Personal information, portfolio content, and wording
